# Lab overview
# In Python, string and numeric data types are often used in groups called collections. Three such collections that Python supports are the list, the tuple, and the dictionary.

# In this lab, you will:

# Use the list data type
# Use the tuple data type
# Use the dictionary data type

#Defining a list :In this activity, you will edit a Python script to hold a collection of fruit names, or a list of fruit.
myFruitList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(myFruitList)
print(type(myFruitList))
print(myFruitList[0])
print(myFruitList[1])
print(myFruitList[2])
myFruitList[2] = "orange"
print(myFruitList)

#Defining a tuple: The tuple is like a list, but it can't be changed
myFinalAnswerTuple = ("apple", "banana", "pineapple")
print(myFinalAnswerTuple)
print(type(myFinalAnswerTuple))
print(myFinalAnswerTuple[0])
print(myFinalAnswerTuple[1])
print(myFinalAnswerTuple[2])

#Defining a dictionary : A dictionary is a list with named positions (keys). Imagine that your list shows peopleâ€™s favorite fruit.
myFavoriteFruitDictionary = {
  "Akua" : "apple",
  "Saanvi" : "banana",
  "Paulo" : "pineapple"
}
print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary)
print(type(myFavoriteFruitDictionary))
print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Akua"])
print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Saanvi"])
print(myFavoriteFruitDictionary["Paulo"])
